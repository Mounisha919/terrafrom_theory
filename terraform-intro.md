## 🌍 What is Terraform?

**Terraform** is an **open-source**, **cloud-agnostic** tool for managing infrastructure as code (**IaC**).

* **Open-source** → Free and customizable.
* **Cloud-agnostic** → Works across AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.

---

## 🧠 How Terraform Works

Terraform uses **declarative** `.tf` files written in **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**:

> "You declare *what* you want, Terraform figures out *how* to get it."

## 🔄 Terraform Lifecycle (Step-by-Step)

| Step     | Command              | Purpose                  |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Code     | –                    | Write config in `.tf`    |
| Init     | `terraform init`     | Initialize project       |
| Validate | `terraform validate` | Check config correctness |
| Plan     | `terraform plan`     | Preview changes          |
| Apply    | `terraform apply`    | Create/update infra      |
| Destroy  | `terraform destroy`  | Delete infra             |

---

## ⚙️ Change Automation

Terraform automates infrastructure changes. You get predictable, consistent deployments.

| Concept        | Meaning                               | Command Example               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Execution Plan | Preview of what Terraform will do     | `terraform plan`              |
| Resource Graph | Visual map of dependencies            | `terraform graph`             |
| ChangeSet      | History of changes (like Git commits) | `terraform show` or `git log` |

---

## 📊 Visualizing Execution Plans

Use this to create visual diagrams of dependencies:

```bash
terraform graph | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg
```

* Requires **GraphViz** installed.
* Shows **which resources depend on others** and execution order.

## 🧩 Terraform Core vs Plugins

| Component      | Role                                                     | Example                    | Analogy       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Terraform Core | Main engine – parses config, creates plan, calls plugins | Built-in by HashiCorp      | Brain         |
| Plugins        | Actual executors – talk to AWS, GCP, etc.                | AWS, Azure, Docker plugins | Workers       |
| RPC            | Protocol Core uses to talk to plugins                    | Remote Procedure Call      | Communication |
| Written in     | Go language (both core and plugins)                      | Fast and compiled          | Language      |

---

### 🔌 Types of Plugins

Terraform plugins extend its functionality. There are four main types:

1. **Provider Plugins**

   * Interact with APIs of cloud providers and services.
   * Examples: `aws`, `google`, `azurerm`, `kubernetes`, `mysql`, `datadog`

2. **Provisioner Plugins**

   * Used to execute scripts on a resource after it's created.
   * Examples: `remote-exec`, `local-exec`, `file`

3. **Backend Plugins**

   * Define **where Terraform stores state** (local, S3, Azure Blob, GCS, etc.)
   * Not declared like other plugins; configured in the backend block.

4. **Authenticator Plugins**

   * Handle secure credential exchanges for providers.
   * Example: AWS SSO, Azure CLI login, Vault.

---

### 🧠 Interview Tip

> "Terraform Core is the brain — it reads your `.tf` code and sends instructions to plugins, which do the actual work like creating VMs or networks."

> "Plugins include providers (AWS, Azure), provisioners (scripts), backends (S3), and authenticators."

## ✅ Terraform Use Cases

| Use Case                | Simple Meaning                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Exotic Providers        | Works with less common APIs (e.g., Heroku, GitHub)     |
| Multi-Tier Apps         | Split into frontend/backend/database modules           |
| Disposable Environments | Quickly create & destroy demo/test infra               |
| Resource Schedulers     | Schedule jobs or manage Spark, Docker, Hadoop clusters |
| Multi-Cloud Deployment  | Manage AWS + GCP + Azure from one script               |

## 🆚 Docker vs Packer – Easy Comparison

| Feature                        | **Docker** 🐳                              | **Packer** 📦                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                    | Runs applications in **containers**        | Builds **machine images** (like AMIs, VMs)  |
| **Use Case**                   | Used to package and run lightweight apps   | Used to create pre-baked server images      |
| **Output**                     | Docker Image (for containers)              | VM Image (e.g., AWS AMI, Vagrant box, etc.) |
| **Example Usage**              | Running Node.js app in a container         | Creating a custom Ubuntu image with Apache  |
| **Runs on**                    | Docker Engine (container runtime)          | No runtime needed after image is built      |
| **Provisioning**               | Not for full OS setup                      | Supports shell, Ansible, Chef, etc.         |
| **Speed**                      | Very fast startup (containers)             | Slower (full VM build)                      |
| **Integration with Terraform** | Terraform can use Docker to run containers | Terraform can use Packer-built AMIs         |
| **Best For**                   | Microservices, CI/CD, DevOps pipelines     | Immutable infrastructure, golden images     |

---

### 🧠 Simple Explanation

* **Docker**:

  > "I want to run my app fast and light — use Docker."

* **Packer**:

  > "I want to **bake everything into an image** (OS + software), and deploy that image later — use Packer."

---

### 🗣 Interview Statement

> “Docker is used to **run applications in containers**, while Packer is used to **build machine images** like AMIs. I use Docker for development and microservices. I use Packer when I need full server images ready to be launched.”

---

## 🔧 Terraform Provisioners

Provisioners in Terraform allow us to **run scripts or commands** to set up or configure resources **after** they are created.

---

### ✅ General Provisioners Summary

| Provisioner                  | Use Case                                      | What It Does                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Cloud-Init**               | Used when VM is first launched                | Runs bash/YAML script on startup |
| **Packer**                   | Used before deployment                        | Builds custom machine image      |
| **Provisioner (in general)** | Used **after resource creation** by Terraform | Installs, edits, sets up VM      |

---

### ☁️ Cloud-Init

> **"Cloud-Init is an industry standard for cross-platform cloud instance initializations."**

✅ Simple Terms:

* Used on cloud platforms when launching a VM.
* You provide a **YAML or Bash script**, and it runs on **first boot**.
* Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
```

🗣 *“Cloud-Init runs a script automatically when the VM boots — like installing updates.”*

---

### 📦 Packer

> **"Packer is an automated image-builder service."**

✅ Simple Terms:

* You define a **template file**, and Packer:

  1. Spins up a base VM
  2. Runs provisioners (Ansible, Bash, etc.)
  3. Creates an image (like AWS AMI)
* That image can be used later in Terraform or other tools.

🗣 *“Packer creates a ready-made machine image I can reuse anytime in Terraform.”*

---

## ⚙️ Terraform Provisioner: `local-exec`

### 🔍 Definition

> **“Local-exec allows you to execute local commands after a resource is provisioned.”**

✅ Meaning:

* You can run shell/CLI commands on **your local machine** (or CI/CD server) **after Terraform provisions** a resource.
* Good for sending data, notifications, or triggering external scripts.

---

### 💻 Where does it run?

> “The machine that is executing Terraform (`terraform apply`) is where the command will execute.”

✅ Examples:

* **Your laptop**
* **Jenkins / GitHub Actions**
* **Terraform Cloud run environment**

---

### 🔁 Outputs vs `local-exec`

| Feature               | Description                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Terraform Outputs** | Shows values after `terraform apply`   |
| **local-exec**        | Executes shell/CLI command after apply |

🧠 *Outputs = Display values*
🧠 *Local-exec = Take action with those values*

---

### 🧾 Example: Save Private IP

```hcl
provisioner "local-exec" {
  command = "echo ${self.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt"
}
```

This stores the VM’s private IP into a local file.

---

### 🧰 Optional Arguments

| Argument      | Description                                  | Example                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `command`     | The main command to run                      | `echo "done"`                                  |
| `working_dir` | Directory to run command from                | `/home/user/project`                           |
| `interpreter` | Which shell/language to run the command with | `["bash", "-c"]`, `["PowerShell", "-Command"]` |
| `environment` | Env variables to pass into command           | `{ KEY = "abc" }`                              |

🧪 Sample with interpreter:

```hcl
provisioner "local-exec" {
  interpreter = ["PowerShell", "-Command"]
  command     = "Get-Date >> completed.txt"
}
```

---

### 🔁 Use Case

> After provisioning a VM, send its public IP to a firewall, API, or Slack bot.

```hcl
command = "curl -X POST -d ${self.public_ip} https://api.example.com/update"
```

---

### 🗣 Interview Answer

> "`local-exec` lets me run local commands right after Terraform creates a resource. I can use it to log details, configure tools, or run scripts on my local or CI/CD machine. It supports environment variables, different interpreters like PowerShell or Bash, and can execute any command I pass."
