---

### 🔒 **1. Boundary**

> **Purpose:** Secure remote access to systems
> ✅ Based on **trusted identity**, not IPs
> ✅ Great for replacing VPNs or SSH bastions
> ✅ Just-in-time credentials access

---

### 🌐 **2. Consul**

> **Purpose:** Service discovery and configuration
> ✅ Acts as a **service mesh**
> ✅ Enables secure communication between services
> ✅ Supports service segmentation (zero-trust)
> ✅ Offers **key-value storage** for configs
> ✅ Works across **cloud, hybrid, or on-prem**

---

### ⚙️ **3. Nomad**

> **Purpose:** Scheduling and orchestration of applications
> ✅ Lightweight **orchestration tool**
> ✅ Can deploy apps to **VMs or containers**
> ✅ Runs across **clusters of worker nodes**
> ✅ Simpler alternative to Kubernetes in some use cases

---

### 📦 **4. Packer**

> **Purpose:** Create **golden machine images**
> ✅ Builds **virtual machine images** (e.g., AMIs, GCP Images, etc.)
> ✅ Used for **immutable infrastructure**
> ✅ Integrates with Terraform to speed up deployments
> ✅ Eliminates the need for post-boot configuration scripts

---

### 🌍 **Terraform**

> **Tool for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

✅ Lets you **provision, manage, and destroy** infrastructure using simple code
✅ Supports **all major cloud providers** (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
✅ You write `.tf` files (Terraform code) to create infrastructure

> **Terraform Cloud**
> ☁️ A managed service to **store, run, and collaborate** on Terraform code
> ✅ Great for **teams**, version control, and centralized state files

---

### 💻 **Vagrant**

> **Tool to create and manage lightweight development environments**

✅ Helps developers **quickly spin up VMs** on their laptop
✅ Uses virtualization (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.)
✅ Ensures everyone on the team has the **same dev setup**
✅ Ideal for **local testing**, sandboxing, and simulating servers

---

### 🔐 **Vault**

> **Secrets Management Tool**

✅ Used to **securely store and access secrets** like:

* API keys
* Database passwords
* Certificates

✅ Supports:

* **Identity-based access**
* **Dynamic secrets**
* **Audit logging**

🔒 Example: Instead of hardcoding credentials in your app, **fetch them securely from Vault**.
